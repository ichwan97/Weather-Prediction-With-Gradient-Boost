# Weather Prediction With Gradient Boost
This is a code implementation of the published Medium Article: *Weather Prediction With Gradient Boost*  

In this article, you will learn some training algorithms & models to predict the weather from rainfall, temp_max, temp_min, and wind data. You will also find several training algorithms & models to test one by one and why gradient enhancement is the best choice for predicting the weather.

## Requirements
```
numpy, pandas, seaborn, matplotlib, scipy, sklearn, xgboost
```
